### Background

Every day, millions of consumers voice their opinions in product-review websites, blogs,
and chat rooms. They spontaneously produce massive amounts of user-generated content
(UGC), most of which is textual and freely available for analysis. At the same time,
online and offline retailers collect rich data sets that contain valuable information
about the purchases of individual customers. In this era of big data, the availability of
new, larger, and more diversified data sets creates exciting opportunities for marketing
researchers and practitioners.

All that is needed to address these challenges is the right set of tools and the training
that helps you to use the tools correctly. This course first teaches how to formalize
marketing problems as statistical models. It then shows how to solve marketing problems by
complementing classical econometric techniques with modern machine learning (ML) methods.
You will find tools and conceptual frameworks needed to identify and exploit the
opportunities that big data sources create.

The course has three modules, each containing lectures and hands-on activities. In the
first module (“Mine your Own Business in Blogs, Reviews and Tweets”), we will work with
various types of UGC, with a strong emphasis on textual data. We will discuss and use
tools to help you automate the detection of both content and sentiment from texts produced
by consumers. The second module (“Purchase Prediction with Boosted Trees”) focuses on the
application of supervised ML methods to predictive and prescriptive marketing problems.
The module also introduces important theoretical and practical principles for designing
and implementing ML pipelines. In the third module (“Neural Networks–From Market Structure
Analysis to Prescriptive Marketing”), we will use representation learning and deep
learning techniques to model market structures in retailing applications and leverage
insights for prescriptive marketing applications. There is one major “module assignment”
to be handed in at the end of each module. In the assignments you will apply the methods,
templates, and scripts seen during the lectures.

### Learning goals

This course will push you to develop new analytical skills and to be creative when
devising solutions and interpreting your results to understand the consumer behavior that
generated the data you are analyzing. In addition, you will not only apply existing
modeling libraries but also implement models and algorithms (almost) from scratch. After
completing this course, you will be able to judge how modern machine learning methods (ML)
complement (or even replace) traditional statistical methods for data analysis and
decision-making. The course is designed to prepare you for solving real-world marketing
problems using modern quantitative methods.

After this course, you will be able to:

1. Formulate marketing decisions as machine learning tasks.
2. Build well-structured and robust machine learning data/model pipelines.
3. Extract relevant insights on consumer preferences and behavior from user-generated
   content (UGC).
4. Analyze real-world loyalty card data to solve prescriptive marketing problems.
5. Collaborate efficiently when working on data science projects in teams.
6. Infer machine learning best practices from academic literature.
